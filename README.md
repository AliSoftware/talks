# Talks

I love teaching, sharing and talking at conferences.

In this page you'll find references to my past or upcoming talks about Swift & stuff.

If youâ€™re interested in having me speak at a conference you are organizing, please send me a message at <olivier@halligon.net> or join me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/aligatr). Thanks!
